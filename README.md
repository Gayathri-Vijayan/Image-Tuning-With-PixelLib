# Image-Tuning-With-PixelLib
Image tuning is the change in the background of an image through image segmentation. The key role of image segmentation is to remove the objects segmented from the image and place it in the new background created. This is done by producing a mask for the image and combining it with the modified background.

Deeplabv3+ model trained on pascalvoc dataset is used. The model supports 20 common object catefories which means you can change the background of these objects as you desired. 

The objects are:

Person, bus,car,aeroplane, bicycle, ,motorbike,bird, boat, bottle,  cat, chair, cow, dinningtable, dog,
horse pottedplant, sheep, sofa, train, tv
